# Freelancer Contest 1 - Real-Time JSON Sync

## Project Overview
This project involves syncing JSON files in real-time using PHP without any frameworks like Laravel or CodeIgniter. The `.json` file holds dynamic data (such as logs or statistics) that updates in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Updates**: The page automatically refreshes only when the `.json` file data changes.
- **Manual Refresh Logging**: The script logs only manual refreshes triggered by the user (via F5 or URL access).
- **No Frameworks**: This project is implemented purely in PHP, without the use of any frameworks like Laravel or CodeIgniter.

### Requirements:
- PHP 7.4+ (or any compatible version)
- A web server with PHP support

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/freelancer-contest1.git`
2. Set up the web server to point to the project directory.
3. Make sure to place the `data.json` file in the appropriate location.
